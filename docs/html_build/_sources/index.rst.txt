======================
Welcome to delensalot
======================

Curved-sky quadratic and iterative CMB delensing tools.

Lensing reconstruction, B-lensing template generation and power spectrum calculation of (partially delensed) maps.

Includes quadratic estimated and iterative lensing reconstruction on map-, and spectrum level.

Quadratic estimated lensing reconstruction comes from the built-in interface to `Plancklens`_.
Iterative lensing reconstruction comes from the curved sky implementation of `LensIt`_.
delensalot is best used via :ref:`Configuration Files`.

If you are new to delensalot, go check out how to :ref:`get started`.
