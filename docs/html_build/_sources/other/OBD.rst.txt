Overlapping B-mode deprojection (OBD)
=========================================

We deproject the simulation/data B-modes which overlap with the modes we want to reconstruct by applying high noise to those.

The delensalot-job to create the OBD matrix is:code:`OBD_builder`. An interactive minimal working example can be found `here`_
