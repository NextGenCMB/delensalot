delensalot is computationally demanding.
Depending on your configuration, it may be advisable to use its built-in :code:`MPI`-support,

In general, delensalot distributes simulations across :code:`MPI`-jobs, and will return information about the :code:`MPI`-distribution upon runtime.

To use :code:`MPI`, simply run delensalot using slurms :code:`srun` command,

.. code-block:: bash

    srun -n N -c C python3 dlensalot/run.py -p <path/to/config.py>
