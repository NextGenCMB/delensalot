Welcome to D.lensalot
===============================

Curved-sky quadratic and iterative CMB lensing tools.

Lensing reconstruction, B-lensing template generation and power spectrum calculation of (partially) delensed maps.


Includes quadratic estimated and iterative lensing reconstruction on map-level.
All calculations are done on curved sky.

Quadratic estimated lensing reconstruction comes from the built-in interface to `Plancklens`_.
Iterative lensing reconstruction comes from the curved sky implementation of `LensIt`_.
D.lensalot is controlled via :ref:`Configuration Files`.
