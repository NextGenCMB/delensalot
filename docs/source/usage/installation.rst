Installation
==============

Download the project at `github`_, navigate to the root folder and execute,

.. code-block:: bash

    python setup.py install

:code:`D.lensalot` currently requires an older gnu compiler, `gcc 7`, to work.
The only reason for this incompatibility is that a newer version is more restrictive to type checking.
